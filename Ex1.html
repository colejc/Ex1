        This project was a 10-week long design sprint in which a team of four UX designers created 
        an educational board game based on the different types of government.
    </p>

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, we researched different board games and worked with students to learn about their needs.</li>
        <li>Second, we prototyped the basic interactions we wanted in our game.</li>
        <li>Third, we continued to test and iterate on our design until we had a high-fidelity version of the game.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>What I learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Creating something to be fun, like a game, can require a lot of interesting decisions.</li>
        <li>Scoping a project is an extremely important step.</li>
        <li>Projects can turn out differently than you first expected, and that's ok.</li>
    </ul>
